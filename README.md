# **🚀 End-to-End Chatbot Deployment: Proof of Concept 🖼️🤖**  

This tutorial walks through deploying a **full-stack chatbot** as a **proof of concept**. It covers:  
✅ **AWS Lambda Function** for AI-powered responses  
✅ **REST API** using API Gateway with a **POST method**  
✅ **Handling both text-only & text+image inputs** 📜🖼️  
✅ **Simple Web UI using Streamlit**

## **📌 Tutorial Overview**  

### **1️⃣ AWS Lambda Function 🖥️**  
- Deploy a **serverless function** that interacts with AWS Bedrock.  
- Supports both **text-only** and **text+image** inputs.  

### **2️⃣ REST API 🌐**  
- Stand up a **RESTful API** via **AWS API Gateway**.  
- Enables the web UI to communicate with the backend.  
- Implements a **POST method** to send user queries.  

### **3️⃣ Handling Input Types 🧠**  
- If the request contains **only text**, the system handles it as a **chatbot query**.  
- If the request includes an **image**, it processes it for **OCR or visual analysis** before responding.

## **🎨 Web-Based UI: Streamlit**  

A lightweight **Streamlit app** is provided to interact with the chatbot. It includes:  
✅ **Simple UI** for sending text or uploading images  
✅ **Sidebar controls** for model parameters  
✅ **Docker support** for easy deployment  

📁 **Check the Streamlit app code inside the** `app/` **folder**.  
For UI-specific setup and deployment, refer to the **README inside `app/`**.
